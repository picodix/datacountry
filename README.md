# **Introduction**

> All the data described bellow is available in the form of a monolithic json file named using 2 letters country code (_ISO 3166-1 alpha-2_) like so: **nz.json**. In the future I might split the file using the different categories described bellow. <br><br>
> The scraping process can take quite some time (even being fully automated) but I will make sure to update the repo with newest countries as soon as it's ready.
